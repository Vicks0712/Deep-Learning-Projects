# Classification of Brain Tumors with Deep Learning

## Context

In the field of medicine and medical imaging, accurate identification of brain tumors plays a critical role in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases. This project focuses on the classification of brain tumor images into three main categories: glioma, meningioma and pituitary tumor, using Deep Learning techniques.

The top model, ResNet18, achieved an impressive 99% accuracy in classifying brain tumor images. This research contributes to improving accuracy and automation in brain tumor diagnosis, which could have a significant impact on medical care and patient well-being.
