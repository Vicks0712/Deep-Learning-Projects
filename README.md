# Deep-Learning-Projects

### Description
This repository contains a number of Deep Learning projects related to image classification, real-time object identification, image autocoloring, and natural language processing. Projects incorporate advanced approaches, such as LSTM networks, Seq2Seq, attention, and teaching enforcement. Each project reflects a milestone in the field of Deep Learning. 

### Examples of Featured Projects
The following projects are some of the most relevant when entering the world of machine learning. From the understanding of key libraries such as OpenCV, pytorch, etc., to the creation of our own networks for various purposes.
- **Real-Time Shape Management (Virtual Whiteboard):** An initial implementation using OpenCV that allows real-time shape tracking and management, providing a virtual whiteboard-like experience. It is a first approach for those people who do not know OpenCV and its capabilities.
- **Image Autocoloring:** A project that demonstrates the ability to train Deep Learning models to automatically add color to black and white images, highlighting creativity in image processing.
- **Brain Tumor Classification (99.02%)**: An important effort in the detection and classification of brain tumors using medical image processing techniques and Deep Learning models, with the aim of contributing to medical care.
- **Text Classifier with LSTM and GloVe:** A natural language processing project that uses LSTM neural networks and GloVe pre-trained vectors for text classification, addressing text analysis and categorization tasks. It is a good first approach to understand the general modulation of natural language processing models.
In addition to the examples mentioned above, you will find a variety of additional projects exploring different approaches and technologies.
